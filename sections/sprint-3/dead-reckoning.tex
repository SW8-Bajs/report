\section{Dead reckoning}
Dead reckoning is a technique that is used to predict where a game object is at current time based on its last know position, velocity and acceleration.
It is often used for networking games where packages about the object's kinematic state are continuously being sent from the server to the clients.
The kinematic state of an object includes its position, velocity, acceleration, orientation and angular velocity.
If the client misses a package or they are not being sent often enough to have a new update for each frame, the representation of the object will jerk across the screen instead of having smooth and consistent movement.
That is where dead reckoning can be used to predict an objects movement to make it appear more believeable.
For the game we're building, it is important that each player's and the ball's positions are very accurate for the game to function properly.
Dead reckoning can be used to smooth out the positional representation of the ball and the players.
