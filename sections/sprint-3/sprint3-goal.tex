\section{sprint goal and introduction}
The main goal for sprint 3 in terms of implementation is to achieve a minimum viable product(MVP).
To do this, the game should be able to receive positional data from the Pozyx system.
This data should then be formatted and used to update the positions of the players.
On top of this, the host should be able to calculate when a player has entered the opposition's goal with the ball, and notify the players that a goal was scored.
Finally, a win condition should be implemented such that a game can end, such as one team reaching three goals scored.
