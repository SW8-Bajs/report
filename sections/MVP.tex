\section{Minimum viable product}
To be able to test the game with users as fast as possible, we establish a minimal viable product with functional and non-functional requirements.
The features required for a minimum viable product includes:

\subsection{Functional requirements}
These functional features are essential to make the game work.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Must be possible to start the game.
    \item Must be able to connect to the server from the clients.
    \item The users must be able to see their current positions.
    \item The users must be able to view the playing field, the goals, the players, the ball position and the current score on their mobile device.
    \item Must be able to win the game.
    \item The game must be able to be viewed through VR googles.
    \item The game must be dynamic, so that multiple players can be added(game information)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
These requirements are more difficult to evaluate than the functional requirements and to test it a usability test must be conducted.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The design of the field must be pleasant for the user to see through a VR headset.
    \item The users should receive enough updates, so that the positions of the players represent their real position.
\end{itemize}
