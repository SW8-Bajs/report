  Can Pozyx, a highly accurate positioning solution using UWB, be used to create a virtual reality game that represents the user with real-time positional data in-game?\\
  In this project, we look into how to obtain positional data, model a network protocol for transferring the data to the players, and create a virtual reality-based game that shows the positional data in real-time.\\
  In developing the project, the pragmatic paradigm presented in Essence will be utilized to encourage innovation and divergent thinking in the development process.\\
  The results show that while Pozyx provides high accuracy, the refresh rate that we were able to achieve using it was not fast enough for a real-time experience.\\
  It is concluded that combining Pozyx with a technique like dead reckoning would possibly improve the experience.
