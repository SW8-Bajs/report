\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter will define the initial aspects of this project.
It will introduce the overall idea, which was inspired by the supervisor's project proposal.
It will then discuss what is required when designing mobile applications, and define a minimum viable product.
Since the project is concerned with a mobile application, the term \textit{mobility} will be explored.
Finally, the chapter introduces the process used for most of the development, making use of the \textit{Essence} process.
