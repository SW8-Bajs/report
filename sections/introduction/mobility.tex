\section{Mobility}\label{sec:mobility}
As a part of the study regulation it is emphasized that the system needs to be mobile.
The core of the project idea, as described in \autoref{sec:projectidea}, is that the players are mobile and can use VR goggles to view the game.
To achieve this form of mobility, the system needs to handle wireless communication between users and determine the location of players in real-time.

We also desire to have the entire system as being mobile, so that you would be able to set up the game at most locations, either indoors or outdoors.
This can however be more challenging, as some type of location-based service has to be used, which will require some type of connection between users to be able to communicate.
Setting up the game at different locations also requires more knowledge about the game from the user than the regular player would have, as the users have to set up the sensors at correct positions to measure the distance between the components.
