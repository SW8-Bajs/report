\section{Minimum viable product}\label{sec:mvp}
To be able to evaluate the game with users as fast as possible, we establish a minimal viable product with functional and non-functional requirements.
In \autoref{sec:design-intro} we explained how context is an important part of designing a mobile application.
Before establishing the requirements, the context will thus be analyzed.

\subsection{The context for the application}
In terms of context, there is a distinction between \textit{Context} and \textit{context}.
\textit{Context} enables better understanding of a thing by adding information to it.
In order to provide \textit{Context}, certain questions can be answered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What problems are you deisgning a solution for, and what value do you want to bring?
    \item Who are the users, what is known about them and how will they interact with the design?
    \item What interaction is happening and where?
    \item How is the idea different from other deisgns already available?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional requirements}
These functional features are essential to make the game work and are the core features of the game.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Must be possible to start the game.
    \item Must be able to connect to the server from the clients.
    \item The users must be able to see their current positions.
    \item The users must be able to view the playing field, the goals, the players, the ball position, and the current score on their mobile device through VR goggles.
    \item A team must be able to win the game based on their score.
    \item The game must be dynamic, which includes:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Support an arbitrary number of players.
              \item Size of the playing field can be set to a preferable size by the user.
              \item Set how many goals needed to score to win.
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
These requirements are more difficult to evaluate than the functional requirements and to test it a usability test must be conducted.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The design of the field must be pleasant for the user to look at through a VR headset.
    \item The users should receive enough updates so that the positions of the players represent their real position.
\end{itemize}
