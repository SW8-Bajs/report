\section{Designing for mobile devices}\label{sec:design-intro}
Designing for mobile devices requires that certain questions be clarified.
One of these questions is what type of device is being designed for, such as tablets, phones or wearables.
Along with the type of device, certain things must be taken into account, such as the design language that is appropriate for the device, the way the device is interacted with,  how to facilitate touch interaction, as well as the different people expected to use the software being designed.
The main reasoning for having to think about design in this way is that users are not perfect.
They will not use the design the way the developers intended, they are different and use different devices, they are not designers themselves and they are unforgiving.
Ultimately, the users are not the problem, the design is.
In order to take this into account, we will establish requirements by looking at the context within which the game will be used and define a minimum viable product in \autoref{sec:mvp}.
We will also define prototypes for the design and finally evaluate it in the discussion section in \autoref{chap:conclusion}.
