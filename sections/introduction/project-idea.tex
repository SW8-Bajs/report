\section{Project idea}
The idea for this project is to create a game using augmented reality (AR). 
Two teams will compete againts each other to score the most goals using a ball. 
Each player will be equipped with a Google Cardboard, and these will display the playing field from a top-down 2D view. 
Two achieve this each player's position needs to be tracked as well as where the ball located on the field.
In the top down view each player needs to see the positions of the other players and the ball. 
They also need to see their position on the playing field and where the goalposts are.
