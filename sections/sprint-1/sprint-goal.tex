\section{Sprint goal}\label{sec:sprint1-goals}
The goal for this sprint is to explore the project idea and look for possible solutions to some of the problems that the project idea introduces.
In this sprint, we want to learn more about visualizing the game for the users so they can see themselves in the game as well as the playing field. \\
We will look into using Pozyx to get the corners of the playing field as well as the players' positions in an accurate way with fast updates, and to whether Pozyx is even viable for use in the context of this project an experiment will be conducted where we look into the accuracy of the positional precision of the tags. \\
As this is the first sprint of the project, the main focus is to gain more knowledge about the various aspects of the project and to gain a shared vision amongst the group members as to how the game should work.
This initial shared vision will be achieved by making prototypes of the game as well as architectural diagrams of how different components in the game will work together.
