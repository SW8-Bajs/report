\section{Experiment with Pozyx}
We have created an experiment to test how accurate the tags in Pozyx are.
The primary goal of the experiment was to test the accuracy, but a biproduct of the experiment was to see how many update frequencies there were with each tag.

\subsection{Setup}
The current settings goes for best precision, but gives a smaller amount of updates.

The setup of the experiment as seen on \autoref{fig:experiment-setup}. 
The experiment was conducted indoors in Novi 9. 
The anchors \texttt{0x632b} and \texttt{0x676e} was mounted on a wall 240 centimeters apart and the anchors \texttt{0x6738} and \texttt{0x676c} was mounted on a bulletin board.
The number of cm above the hexadecimal number is the height the anchor was mounted.
There was chosen different heights as Pozyx documentation suggests that not all anchors should have the same height.

The fields was a blackboard where lines were drawn for each 10 centimeters to know the actual position as seen on.

\subsection{Precision with 1 tag} \label{sec:one-tag-precision}
As can be seen on \autoref{app:one-tag}

\paragraph{Update frequency}

\subsection{Precision with 3 tag}

24622 was sometimes fairly inaccurate due to there sometimes being few position updates. 
A few times there were no updates in a 2 seconds time spand.

\subsection{Possible influences on the test}
One thing that could have affected the tags is that we used a blackboard as a measure. 
As there is metal in the blackboard this could have affected the precision on the tags.

In the test with 1 tag, the 0 x coordinate was close to the wall. 
This could have been an influence so that it will be higher than it otherwise would be, as it was difficult to center the tag over the x coordinate where x was 0.
