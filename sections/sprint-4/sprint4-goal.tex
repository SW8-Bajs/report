\section{Sprint goal and introduction}
As a fully functional MVP was not achieved for sprint 3, the main goal for sprint 4 in terms of implementation is to finish such an MVP.
The main lacking feature from the sprint 3 iteration is a lack of functionality to move the player as Pozyx data is received, as well as scoring goals and winning the game.
These functionalities form the basis of the sprint 4 implementation goals.
Another goal for sprint 4 is to perform an initial test of the system in a real setting, in order to discover potential issues that can revised in the final sprint.
