\chapter*{Report structure introduction}
This report is structured based on the pragmatic process employed for the project.
This means it is segregated into chapters based on each sprint that was conducted.
Because of this, information found in previous sections will be continually updated in later chapters, if changes were made to those decisions.
Each section reflects the considerations at the given time of the section being written.\\
The report starts with an introduction chapter, which provides information about the process used.
After this, each chapter will define the work done for each sprint, in the way that chapter 1 is for the first sprint, chapter 2 is for the second sprint and so on.\\
This means that, when reading sections relating to discussions of the process in the sprint based chapters, they might not completely line up with what was defined in the introduction.
Certain other occurrences like this will likely be found in the report, to allow the reader to see how the project evolved throughout the semester.\\\\
