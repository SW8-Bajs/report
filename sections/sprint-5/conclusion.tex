\section{Sprint 5 conclusion}\label{sec:sprint5-conclusion}
This section concludes the final sprint of this project.
Since it is the final sprint, no retrospective will be conducted with the aim to further improve the process.
In terms of the design and interface of the system, sprint 5 focused on testing the system to find potential issues, and fixing the bugs described in \autoref{sec:initial-test} and \autoref{sec:evaluatin_test}.
As such, the design was unchanged this sprint.
