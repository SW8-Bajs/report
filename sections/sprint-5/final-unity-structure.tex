\section{Final unity structure}
In unity there has been create two scenes: StartMenu, and Main scene.
This section will give an overview of these two scenes, and show the game objects that has been used in this project.

\subsection{Start menu}
The start menu is the lobby and the game objects within the scene can be seen on \autoref{fig:startmenu-game-objects}.
The five main game objects are the \texttt{GameStateHandler}, \texttt{ConnectionHandler}, \texttt{EventSystem}, \texttt{Menu}, and the standard \texttt{Main Camera}.
\\
The \texttt{GameState} contains a simple script with GameState information such as Anchor positions, player positions and other different variables used when the game start.
It also contains another script \texttt{DontDestroy}, which ensures that the game object does not get destroyed when changing scene.
\\
\texttt{ConnectionHandler} contains the scripts \texttt{DontDestroy} \texttt{TCPClient}.
The \texttt{TCPClient} receives the information from the host and adds the information received to the \texttt{GameState}.
\\
\texttt{Menu} has multiple gameobjects as children, which are used to specify how the UI should look.
The \texttt{ConnectButton} and \texttt{CancelConnection} uses an \texttt{OnClick} feature in unity, where it call as function to either connect or cancel the connection.
\\
The \texttt{EventSystem} supports sending events to objects based on input as clicks on button or typing in the text field.

\subsection{Main scene}
The main scene is the game scene with the playing field.
The primary objects in main is \texttt{CLIENT}, \texttt{PlayingFieldContainer}, \texttt{Camera Rig} and \texttt{GvrEventSystem}.
These can be seen on \autoref{fig:main-game-objects}.
\\\\
The \texttt{CLIENT} contains the script \texttt{UDPClient}, which instantiates the UDP client and receives player and ball positions.
This script is previously described in \autoref{sec:receiving-the-information}.
\\
The \texttt{PlayingFieldContainer} contains two gameobjects, the \texttt{PlayingField} and \texttt{Goalscore-UI}.
The \texttt{PlayingField} is used to generate the playing field and make sure that it is not larger than the
