\section{Sprint goal and introduction}
With the test results from the previous sprint, the main goal for this final sprint is first and foremost to correct the bugs that were discovered.
Since this is the last sprint, and it is a week shorter than the previous sprints due to time constraints, the focus is shifted from implementing major new features to polishing the currently existing features and prepare the system for a final test.
