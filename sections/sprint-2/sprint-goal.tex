\section{Sprint goal and introduction}\label{sec:sprint1-goals}
The goal for this sprint is to explore the networking side of the project and implement initial versions of the UDP client and server based on what was learned in \autoref{sec:sprint1-networking}.
Additionally, the first version of the game should be created, which allows seeing the game through a VR headset and can show the players moving based on the position of the tags.
